                        <p>Like most website operators, Career-Ready Coding collects non-personally-identifying
                            information of the

                            preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Career-Ready
                            Coding's purpose

                            website.</p>
                        <p>Career-Ready Coding also collects potentially personally-identifying information like

                            blog posts.
                            Career-Ready Coding only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                            circumstances

                            information that Career-Ready Coding gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For

                            address.</p>
