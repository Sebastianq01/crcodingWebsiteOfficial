              Career-Ready Coding<br /><br />7864592054 </address>

            <p>It is Career-Ready Coding's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
              while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://crcoding.org">crcoding.org</a>
              (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "crcoding.org"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
              personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy
              policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this
              information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy
              Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of
              information from other sources.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
              rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our
              Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>Like most website operators, Career-Ready Coding collects non-personally-identifying information of the
              sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
              preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Career-Ready Coding's purpose
              in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Career-Ready Coding's
              visitors use its website. From time to time, Career-Ready Coding may release non-personally-identifying
              information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>Career-Ready Coding also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
              (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://crcoding.org blog posts.
              Career-Ready Coding only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances
              that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Certain visitors to Career-Ready Coding's websites choose to interact with Career-Ready Coding in ways
              that require Career-Ready Coding to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
              information that Career-Ready Coding gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
              ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://crcoding.org to provide a username and email address.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
              transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
              commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
              security.</p>

            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
              These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
              advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows
              ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
              interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Career-Ready Coding and does not cover
              the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>


            <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
              party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy
              Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>

              any third party sites, products or services.</p>

            <h2>Crcoding.org uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
            <p>Crcoding.org uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to
              previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed
              a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of
              an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party
              vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data
              collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.</p>
            <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if
              you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently
              using a browser plugin.</p>
